## Four Criteria for Free Software
### Why is it important to choose a LICENSE
Before you choose a license, the project is not considered open source because you have a copyright for it. In order to make it legally open source, you need to find a license for the project. Then, you need to determine how people should use the project and what responsibilities do they have when they modify the project for their own needs. Depending on what responsibilities you want a user to have, you are able to pick a license that matches that.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
If a project does not have a license, this means that the code is copyrighted by the person who made it. This means that there are potetially legal problems if you go and use it.

## Why the Web beat Gopher
I only somewhat agree with the statement that releasing software out into the world sooner is better than later. I think that there is a threshold that the software needs to cross in terms of quality where releasing it before that point would be a mistake. When something is first released, that is when it has the most eyes onto it. If a project is woefully incomplete and missing many critical features, fewer people may be interested in working on it simply because it doesn't look like something that has anything done on it. However, if a project is further along and has most of its critical features done to an extent, people will be more interested in working on it.

## justify why such a license is chosen
Android uses a mix of Apache and GPL licenses. The Apache license allows for proprietary changes to the software, which is important for something like Android which is going to be put onto a wide range of different hardware. Phone and tablet makers want to be able to make changes to the OS to make it work better on their hardware or add in features to make their hardware more desirable.

## Better for developer, company, and common good
For a developer, the most important part of a license is freedom to do what they want. A requirement to distribute changes or publish changes puts more of a burden onto them. Therefore, the LGPL license is probably the best for them. A company would likely prefer the Apache or the BSD license. This is because it allows them modify the software without distributing it. This makes is much easier for them to profit off of the work that they do on the software. For the common good, the best license is the one that is the most open. This makes the GPL license the best for that situation, since source code must be made public for everyone to view

## License for project
I am choosing an MIT license for this project, because I have no intention of profiting from the work. I am okay with anyone using the code I make for whatever project they desire. I would be very happy with others extending the project that I make for their own uses in any way. My goal with my project this semester is simply to make something that teaches me new skills and can potentially be useful to someone. I do not feel that someone who does work with my project should be obligated to do anything with the work, which is why I chose not to use a GPL license.
